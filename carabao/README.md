## Carabao

_ _A carabao is a swamp-type domestic water buffalo, and for a Philippine farmer a carabao is a source of draft animal power which is endlessly helpful for mastering the challenges of his daily life [3]. A Carabao is a MATLAB®-type 'domestic' class object, and for a system-, process- or control-engineer a Carabao is a source of conceptual power which is endlessly helpful for mastering the rapid prototyping challenges of his daily life._ _

## Markdown Language for Documentation

This `README.md` file is written using easy-to-learn `Markdown` for text
formatting, hyperlink support, image embedding, and more. You can visit
[Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
for a `markdown` crashcourse.

On macOS we recommend [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) as markdown editor,
but many editors (like Atom) do the job as well.

## Tools

For efficient work we need the following tools

* git
* github desktop
* python
* pip
* virtual environments
* jupyter lab
* colab

## Git

`Git` is a version control system that allows developers to track a project and actively contribute without interfering in each other’s work. `git` should be pre-installed on recent macOS systems. If not, get instructions from the official `git` web site
https://git-scm.com. With an installed `git` you can use the full function set of `git` from the command line.

## Github Desktop

While `git` is the tool to perform version control, we have `github` as a cloud site to backup the local data on a remote site. [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) is an easy-to-use graphical tool around `git` which performs the `git` operations on mouse click.
